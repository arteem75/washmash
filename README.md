# washmash
Please switch to the master branch to see the files. 
Washmash is an app which manages washing times. Personally, I'm unsatisfied with the fact, that for booking a washing machine I need to go to the basement and do everything manually. An app would solve that problem, as everyone could book time slots via their phone. Another useful feature is saving washing details of certain clothes: the temperature, ironing/bleaching/drying requirements. 

The app uses express js with mongoose (mongoDB) as a backend and a swift app as frontend. 
Possible updates: adding a security layer, user authentification, adding another frontend for some device like arduino to display the timetable in the washing kitchen.
